## Accretion.Intervals
Accretion.Intervals is a general purpose .NET Standard 2.0 library that aims to support broad interval usage scenarios with a simple API. It is now being redesigned from the ground up, on track for the first 10.0.0 release. See issues in this repository to find out the current progress on design and implementation (do note, however, that "tracking" issues are somehwhat inaccurate in their claims that nothing has been done. A lot of the times the code is there but needs to be slightly refactored/renamed/extended to be accepted as an implementation).
